## How to Attribute

To attribute me please include this text (replace `(ref)` by a reference to the image, or a short description/timecode/jumplink):<br/>
Image (ref) by Haz0.2, from [HazOnline.co.uk/images/](https://HazOnline.co.uk/images/index.html), is licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

### For videos
Include this text somewhere in your video or in the description.<br/>
Best practice is to include include attributions while the image is on screen with `(ref)` removed or at the end of the video with `(ref)` replaced with the timecode with the images first appeared.
### For websites
Include this text somewhere in the page.
Best practices is to either have attributions as a caption on the image with `(ref)` empty or the image to have a figure number directly after it and attributions at the bottom.
### For books
Include this text either directly after the image or with the rest of references.
Best practices is to either have attributions as a caption on the image with `(ref)` empty or the image to have a figure number directly after it and attributions at the bottom.

At the very least I want is a link to [HazOnline.co.uk/images/](https://HazOnline.co.uk/images/index.html) when one of my images is used.
